Your homework is to keep working and bring in a rough draft for next
week. I have two quick readings for you:

A kotaku article (which is where I learned about Twine, which I'm sure
you all will agree is pretty great, warts and all):
http://kotaku.com/5979539/a-beginners-guide-to-making-your-first-video-game

And a Source post from Sisi Wei about creating games:
http://source.mozillaopennews.org/en-US/learning/creating-games-journalism/

I also want everyone to register for a Github account. We'll talk a bit
about using Github to manage file changes next week.
