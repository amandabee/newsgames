I'm looking forward to kicking off Newsgames this week with you all.
We'll meet Thursdays at 5 PM in room 436. As previously mentioned, the
class will not meet Oct 17 and will run through Nov 14.

Before we meet, you will need to:

+ Make sure you have a user account on Digital Storage by logging into
the [school password manager][0] and using your school WordPress
credentials. If you don't see connection information for
digitalstorage.journalism.cuny.edu, file a support ticket with the [help
desk][1]. CC me on that ticket so I have a heads up that there's a problem.

+ Install [FileZilla][2] and confirm that you can open it on your laptop.

+ If you don't already have [Textwrangler][3] install that, too.

+ Play [Switch][4] for at least 10 minutes.

+ Identify two news or educational games that you think are great (they
don't have to be digital) and be prepared to discuss the following
questions about each: What is the story that the game tells? What makes
the game succeed? Where does the game falter?

+ Think of two stories you'd like to tell in game form. Write a
pre-pitch of not more than 150 words about each. This can be rough. I
just want you to come to class with some ideas.

Optionally: you might also check out my loose aggregation of games and
ideas [on Tumblr][5]

See you Thursday at 5!

Amanda
