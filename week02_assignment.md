# Week 02

Confirm that you've completed your assignments thus far: 

[ ] Digital Storage password  
[ ] find the URL of a file on digital storage  
[ ] modified and deployed a bingo game.   
 
[ ] pitched at least two possible game-driven stories  
[ ] created a paper prototype for at least one game.  

This week I want you to make sure you're comfortable getting the key for a Google Spreadsheet and adding that into a page that uses the quiz template and deploying it on Digital Storage, so part 1 of your homework is to copy the "Parks Quiz," rename it, get the new key from your new spreadsheet (remember, you have to start publishing it by going to `file > publish to web ...`) and update the HTML for your quiz. Send me the URL for your new quiz. 

We also need to charge forward with our games so your game development work has two parts:

1: Draw or create a flowchart of your game. You can use OmniGraffle or Balsamiq or the Drawing tool in Google Docs or pen and paper, but the diagram should capture the flow of your game so that someone can look it over and understand roughly what actions to expect when they play your proposed game. Your flowchart should reflect the feedback you got in class.

If you're proposing to do calculations in your game, you want to spell out the logic of those calculations. If I choose "Grocery Store" I lose 2 points from my Metro Card balance. If I choose to give $250 to "Wounded Warrior Project" how do you decide what the calculator will show?

2: Start to organize write out your complete texts. If a question in your adventure has choices, what is the text of those choices? Or will you use an image? Use brackets to describe images, if you're going to use them. SO you might wind up with something like this:

DAY 2
title: "The cupboards are bare. You need to go shopping."
text: "The shelter you've been placed in has no grocery stores within walking distance. Your options are to take the train to a real grocery store or shop at a bodega."
option: [bodega image]
option: [grocery store image]
 
You should have a close to complete script by next week. 

Bonus: the earlier you share draft scripts and flowcharts with Martin and I, the more likely it is that we are going to be able to help you work out all the moving pieces.
