This isn't a programming class. This course offers an opportunity to break new ground by introducing audiences to news developments and complex policy stories using games and quizzes as a form of interactive storytelling. 

Why do we need this course?
+ Reporters are being asked to come up with innovative ways to draw readers in online.
+ Games are a time honored teaching tool, and sometimes journalism is about getting complex concepts across, so: teaching.
+ The Internet isn't linear. Learning to write for the web should be learning to think about non linear experiences that engage audiences and tell stories.


## Learning Objectives

At the completion of News Engagement through Games & Quizzes course, you will be able to:

+ Decide which stories lend themselves to game/quiz projects.
+ Conceptualize the basics of building news games and quizzes.
+ Pitch news games and quizzes that tell engaging policy stories
+ Design news games and quizzes that make complex policies more accessible to audiences. 
+ Organize content to design a meaningful  prototype (wireframe/storyboard). 
+ Evaluate whether the prototype (wireframe/storyboard) will lead to effective and engaging news games and quizzes.

Here are a few great examples of games and quizzes as a storytelling mechanism:

+ Budget Puzzle: You Fix the Budget [link: http://nyti.ms/zm6syb]
+ The Garbage Glut [link: http://bit.ly/zaBS6B]
+ Urbanology Online [link: http://bit.ly/wwR9pc]
+ Newt or Schrute: the Quiz [link: http://bit.ly/wmypt7]

## Structure

You will work in small groups to design and build interactive and engaging news games that tell a substantive story well and get readers interested in an issue. 

They’ll develop a pitch, an offline game prototype, and then a working online game, stopping along the way to make sure the game is still about the news story that sparked it.

### Week-by-Week
 
Class 1: What makes a news game newsworthy?
Evaluate existing games, discuss your game ideas and break into small groups to start working out how ideas might play out as games. 
 
Class 2: Game play and storytelling
Bring in offline prototypes of their games that the class can play and evaluate. Together, we’ll ask whether the news event is still at the center of the game and whether the game play is intuitive enough to succeed online. We’ll also start looking at data structure, to make sure you can develop a clear roadmap of all the texts and facts they’ll need to build the final game.
 
Class 3: Programming simple interactions
The third week will be the most technical. You will have played and revised their games and will come to class armed with the texts and images that you want players to encounter during the course of play. We’ll look at how to program and troubleshoot interactions between player and server. 
 
Class 4: Working wireframes
By week four games will be “done,” and eady for some tough feedback about what’s missing from the games.
 
Class 5: Playable demos
You won’t finish the module with games that are ready for the New York Times interactive desk, but we will finish with functional games we can be proud of. We’ll discuss opportunities to extend the games and add complexity and make the games more engaging.
