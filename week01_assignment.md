## Get started on texts

If you haven't already come up with a story, listen to Latashs's story on [City in Demand](http://www.city-in-demand.com)  and write 8 questions, each with at least two answers that gets at the key takeaway: Shelter residents move around all the time; there's a lot of paperwork: all those safety nets take proof. 

If you have a story that you're already focused on, you can write your questions and answers about that story. Start by identifying the key takeaway of your "quiz."
