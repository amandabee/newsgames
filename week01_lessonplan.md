Week 2 Lesson Plan

Homework Review:
+ Pitch discussion (How are pitches coming, what do we think of one another's pitches?)


+ Play the [Parks Game]]http://www.gothamgazette.com/parksgame/) from Gotham Gazette. Is this a CYOA or a quiz? (Actually, it's a mix: on some questions, there's only one right answer and you can't move on until you get it. On others, it's a sorting-style game.) Screenshots on Baker (Public > Newsgames)

## Prototypes
Why am I torturing you with paper prototypes? [Because they're important](http://nerds.texastribune.org/post/62939230080/friends-with-benefits-adapting-mojos-cyoa-app).
+ Play through prototypes; take notes on game play.
+ Start to lay out how your game texts need to be structured; where you need graphics

## Graphics
The obvious solution is to draw it yourself. 

+ Images and where to find royalty free graphics. 
+ + Public Domain images  
+ + Creative Commons licenses
