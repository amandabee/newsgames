# Choose Your Own Adventure

Some simple choose your own adventure games in the news: 
+ From Texas Tribune, [an Obamacare game](http://www.texastribune.org/library/data/quiz-health-insurance-options-obamacare/) and another on [Medicaid expansion](http://www.texastribune.org/library/data/interactive-should-texas-expand-medicaid/).
+ A modified [park planning adventure](http://www.gothamgazette.com/parksgame/) from Gotham Gazette. Is this a CYOA or a quiz? (Actually, it's a mix: on some questions, there's only one right answer and you can't move on until you get it. On others, it's a sorting-style game.)





This is a great and grounding post that explains, in part, why we're starting on paper: you need a road map.
