# Quizzes

NY Times has a series called "Well Quiz"

From [The Well Quiz](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/category/the-well-quiz/), 
[Can You Read Peopleâ€™s Emotions?](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/well-quiz-the-mind-behind-the-eyes/) and [Well Flu](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/the-well-flu-quiz/)

From Craft II on [Bloomberg's Legacy](http://bloomberglegacy.nycitynewsservice.com/bloombergs-new-york-city-take-the-quiz/)

We're going to use Mother Jones' [quiz framework](https://github.com/motherjones/newsquiz) to make a super basic quiz. 

My starting point: <http://digitalstorage.journalism.cuny.edu/amandahickman/newsgames/quiz/>

We're going to play a bit with Tabletop.js -- if you don't know it, [Source has a nice write up](http://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/ultralight-cmses/) and Mike Ball has [another](http://www.mikeball.us/blog/using-google-spreadsheets-and-tabletop-js-as-a-web-application-back-end)


And we're going to use a little jQuery. We're actually just going to pull in an external js file for jQuery [we're not going to host it ourselves, though](https://encosia.com/3-reasons-why-you-should-let-google-host-jquery-for-you/)


Everyone pick your favorite stat out of Stats and the City and we'll make a boro test:
