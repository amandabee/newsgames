## Finding Graphics
The obvious solution is to draw it yourself. 

+ Images and where to find royalty free graphics. 
+ + Public Domain images  
+ + Creative Commons licenses

Google Image search, Flickr license search

Since 2010, Google does [index vector graphics](http://lifehacker.com/5627391/google-now-indexes-scalable-vector-graphics)

## Choose Your Own Adventure
+ From Texas Tribune, [an Obamacare game](http://www.texastribune.org/library/data/quiz-health-insurance-options-obamacare/) and another on [Medicaid expansion](http://www.texastribune.org/library/data/interactive-should-texas-expand-medicaid/).

+ In June of 2012, the US Supreme Court [decided](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/us/supreme-court-lets-health-law-largely-stand.html) that the Affordable care act is legal. But as newswatchers waited for the decision, the NY Times made a [quick game](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/06/14/us/how-the-supreme-court-could-rule-on-the-health-care-law.html) about how they'd decide.

+ Quartz just made a [flow chart](http://qz.com/43112/choose-your-own-adventure-to-avoid-the-us-debt-ceiling/)

Mother Jones has a framework, and I've been [hearing good things](http://kotaku.com/5979539/a-beginners-guide-to-making-your-first-video-game) about Twine

# Digging into Twine

Twine is surprisingly powerful. It can be frustrating (Save often and make backups!) but it does a lot.
